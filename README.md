# Pretty Low Price

For my 5th milestone project, I create an ecommerce website called Pretty Low Price. 
Due to some errors, the code might not show as intended on the heroku app.
## UX
 

- As a user, I want to find the best shopping deals online.
- As a user, I want a simple site where I can easily read what the deals have to offer.
- As a user, I want to pay for an item and have a form in input my details.
